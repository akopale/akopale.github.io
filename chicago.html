                   This project was completed as part of a geographic databases course. Our instructions, in short, were to design and develop a geographic database for an interesting topic that can support various queries.

                  I chose to focus on credibly accused priests in the Catholic Church for three reasons. First, I was looking for a comprehensive geographic database with this information and couldn't find one. Second, pastoral abuse receives significant media coverge, so I knew this would be relevant. And third, the bill for the settlements the Catholic Church has been paying victims is footed by parishoners. The people paying hundreds of millions of dollars should know what they pay hundreds of millions of dollars for.
                </p>
                <br>
                <p>
                  This project needed a database rather than flat files for a multitude of reasons, but primarily because the data are constantly changing. There are trials for accused priests going on as I write this and there will continue to be accusations, investigations, and trials for the foreseeable future. The ability to easily update data makes having a database much more useful than flat files.
